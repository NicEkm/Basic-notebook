# Notebook

This is one of my projects, which shows basic usage of 'pickle' module, how to handle files in python 3 and creating simple notebook for yourself. 

Notebook:

* Is good to learn how python 3 handles files.
* Is good to learn how python 3 uses Try: and Except: commands.
* Takes user input to manipulate the notebook.
* Uses pickle module to encode the file.
* Is good example how to use TIME library to get timestamps using users own local time.

## To note!
There is no GUI made for this program, so it's only for local use in (cmd, or other shell)

## Usage

Simply clone the project and run .py file in terminal or cmd.
